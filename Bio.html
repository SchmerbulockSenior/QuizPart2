			<p id="P1Bio"><br>My life is boring and there's nothing interesting happened so far like going to different places for participating a dance team or singing in a school program/event. I'm Mathew Leyson and I've been a nervous wreck for almost my entire life. Recently I've been able to talk to other people and build up a little bit of confidence to do things I haven't been able to do before. Before I can't even ask a simple question to a stranger regarding directions or something else. I can't even ask my teacher for questions cause I'm afraid of being judged of the way I speak and how my voice sounds.<br><br></p>

           <p id="P1Bio2"><br>I really love to play games and that's what I usually do everytime a I have a spare time I started use computer back when I was 8-9 years old and played a lot of games back then like Habbo Hotel, Pet Society, Counter Strike, Cross-fire, etc. It started when my mom brought me to an Internet Cafe to print her documents then I was curious and interested about the computer so I asked if I could login and use the computer too. I made friends in that internet cafe for coming back so often and I was taught to play other games. Until now I still play a lot of games mostly MOBA's Like DOTA2, LOL, ML:BB.<br><br>

           <p id="P1Bio3"><br>I also love to draw and I do them most of the time. I used to draw al the time wherever I am. But now I only draw in my House because I don't want to get judged compared to other artist, most people who don't do arts compares other artists and this causes artists to lose confidence in their skills. Every artists has their own way, steps, and art style, and should not be compared to other artists. Now I do portraits, and digital arts.
           
           I also love to listen to music and I do it all the time especially when I'm drawing something. I love to explore different music genres and listen to them. I also love to watch anime. The first anime that I watched and finished is Tokyo Ghoul.<br><br></p>


		<h1 id="header3">&nbsp;Childhood</h1>


          <p id="P1Bio4"><br>My childhood isn't that great but even though it wasn't that good there are a lot of things that made up for my "not so great childhood", those are my childhood best friends and my family. My two childhood best friends are amazing and I love them so much, we've been friends since we were 6 years old and we've made a lot of memories together from playing outdoor recreational games like tsinelas lata, bato lata, shatong, bahaw bahaw, sili sili, patentero, and many more. We also go to the park every night to hangout just walk, and talk about different stuff. Until now we are still best friends with them and I'm still in contact with them, now that we three are all in college and we're in different places. One is in Dumaguete and the other one is in Cebu and I'm in Talisay, we stay in contact through messenger, and we play games like ML:BB for our bonding time every saturday night. 
          
          My family played a big part in my "not so great childhood" too, because they've been on my side ever since through hardships and difficulties. My family cared about me and my future so much that they always want what's best for me, to the point where they decide what things I should do and not do, because they think they know what's good and bad for me. Until I reached Senior Highschool where my Mother chose the strand for me instead of me choosing the strand I like, leading me to have problems of overthinking what I Degree Program I should get in college because of the Strand I got in Senior Highschool. They almost decided for me what to take in College which makes me feel down causing me to not talk very much because I didn't like what they've suggested. I decided to come up to them and told them what I've been feeling about them deciding everything what's best for me even though I don't like it, fortunately they took it well and because of that my relationship with my family is now much more open.<br><br></p>
