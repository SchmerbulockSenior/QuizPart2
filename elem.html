        	In my elementary days I don't remember that much but it was fun and delicious because literally it is delicious because we had a Pizza Making back when I was in grade 5 and what fun learning how to make Pizza and after class we had a delicious snack when we play Patentero in the schoolyard. I also made 2 best friends in my Elementary Days they were also kind and helpful, and our friendship is so pure. We used to buy each other snacks when one of us doesn't have one, we used to eat lunch together and share our food, and we play games after school in the schoolyard.<br><br></p>
